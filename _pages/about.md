About Me
---
Hi, my name is Luis Rincon, and I’m currently a Computer Science student at St. Olaf College. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology and how it keeps shaping the way we live. That curiosity naturally grew into a passion for programming, problem-solving, and building projects that can make a real impact.

Research

I am currently interested in front-end development, software engineering, and machine learning with a focus on artificial intelligence. I enjoy exploring how intuitive user interfaces can improve the way people interact with technology, and I’m also drawn to the challenge of building efficient and scalable systems.

In terms of ethics, I want to learn more about how AI impacts privacy, fairness, and human decision-making. I believe it’s important to study how technology can be created responsibly so that innovation benefits everyone without reinforcing harm or inequality.

Personal Life

Outside of my studies, I like gaming, music, and spending time with my friends and family. I’m passionate about working on creative tech projects, whether that’s designing a personal AI assistant or developing fun, interactive applications. Loyalty, curiosity, and growth are values I carry into both my personal and professional life.
