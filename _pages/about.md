This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.


About Me
---
Hi, my name is Luis Rincon, and I’m currently a Computer Science student at St. Olaf College. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology and how it keeps shaping the way we live. That curiosity naturally grew into a passion for programming, problem-solving, and building projects that can make a real impact.

Research 
---
I am currently interested in front-end development, software engineering, and machine learning with a focus on artificial intelligence. I enjoy exploring how intuitive user interfaces can improve the way people interact with technology, and I’m also drawn to the challenge of building efficient and scalable systems.

In terms of ethics, I want to learn more about how AI impacts privacy, fairness, and human decision-making. I believe it’s important to study how technology can be created responsibly so that innovation benefits everyone without reinforcing harm or inequality.

Personal Life
---
Outside of my studies, I like gaming, music, and spending time with my friends and family. I’m passionate about working on creative tech projects, whether that’s designing a personal AI assistant or developing fun, interactive applications. Loyalty, curiosity, and growth are values I carry into both my personal and professional life.
