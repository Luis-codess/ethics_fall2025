Task 1:
---
Superlative Round 1:I chose Society Blog 2 for this superlative, and I picked “Most Informative” because of how much it taught me when I look back at it now. Honestly, the title feels a little questionable without context, but once you actually read the blog, everything makes sense and the topic becomes way more serious. Writing it helped me understand how fast AI companions are growing and how big of an impact they can have on people. Since AI has exploded in the last couple years and still has so much room to evolve, learning about the risks, psychological effects, and ethical concerns felt important.

Superlative Round 2:I chose BIAS Blog 2 and gave it the title “Most Challenging” because it pushed me the hardest out of all my posts. The article broke down seven different sources of harm in machine learning, and coming up with my own examples for each one made me think way more deeply about how bias can appear at any stage. What made this post stand out was how it forced me to connect the concepts to my own aim trainer project, which made me notice blind spots I never would have caught before. Reflecting on it now helps me see how my writing has grown, because instead of just summarizing the article like I used to earlier in the semester, I was actually analyzing things, applying them, and thinking through real-world impacts. That shift in my thinking is why this blog feels so different from the others and why it deserves this superlative.

Big Evolution Check:For my Blog Evolution Check, I chose Ethical Blog 2 because it’s the one I revised the most after getting feedback. The main change I made was fixing my incorrect use of the strawman fallacy, since the article never actually presented an argument that could be misrepresented. With more practice later in the semester, I realized the claim “AI is killing college” fits better as a slippery slope or non-sequitur. I also revised my alternative argument because it repeated points the article already made. Looking back at this blog helped me notice how much clearer and more accurate my writing became once I understood fallacies and argument structure better.

Task 2:

Writing Skills and Growth:Over this semester, I feel like my writing got clearer and more organized. I got better at breaking ideas down instead of trying to explain everything at once. Writing blogs helped me practice making arguments that actually make sense and connect back to real examples. The hardest part for me was identifying fallacies and making sure I used them correctly, but that’s also where I improved the most.

Process Comparison:I honestly liked writing blogs more than traditional essays. Blogs felt more relaxed and let me talk in my own voice, instead of sounding super formal. Writing for an online audience made me focus on keeping things simple and direct, while academic papers usually feel more strict. The blog format just made it easier for me to explain ideas in a way that felt natural.

Patterns and Habits:Looking back at my blogs, I noticed that I usually start with a short summary before giving my own thoughts. Over time, I also started adding more personal examples, which made my writing feel more honest and connected. One habit that changed was how I built my arguments. I got better at explaining why something matters instead of just stating it. My writing feels more confident now compared to the start of the semester.

Task 3:
---
Topics and Themes:The topics I enjoyed writing about the most were the ones that connected AI to real people and everyday life. These topics were interesting because I could relate them to things I have seen or experienced. The prompts that helped me the most were the ones asking for examples or personal connections, because they made it easier for me to build my ideas and understand the topic better.

Knowledge Integration:Writing the blogs definitely helped me understand the course concepts more deeply. Instead of just reading the articles, I had to explain them in my own words and think about how they apply to real situations. A moment that really clicked for me was when I wrote about the seven sources of harm in machine learning. I finally understood how bias can sneak in at any stage and how even small projects can be affected.

Task 4:
---
Future Use of My Website:Now that I have my own blog and website, I can see myself using it to share updates on my projects, especially anything related to AI, coding, or things I build on my own. I like the idea of having a place to track my progress and show the work I am proud of, so I could see myself posting whenever I learn something new or finish a project.

Future Writing Identity:Beyond this class, I think I will become more of a technical and reflective writer. I enjoy explaining how things work and connecting them to real experiences, especially when it comes to technology. 

Personal Writing Goals:My writing goal for next semester is to get better at explaining complex ideas in a simple way. I want my writing to feel clear and natural, even when I am talking about something technical. To move toward that goal, I can practice by writing short summaries of my projects, asking for feedback, and reading writing that is clear and beginner friendly.
