Case Study Summary
---
This case talks about how AI companions can become addictive because they are always available, overly flattering, and personalized to what users want. Mahari and Pataranutaporn explain how that mix can make people depend on them emotionally, especially those who are lonely or isolated. The article also shows how laws and platforms are not ready to deal with these risks yet.

Answering Discussion Questions From Article
---
Question 1 Response:
Companies should design AI companions that care more about the user’s well-being than engagement time. For example, the AI could recognize warning signs like self-harm or extreme dependency and immediately stop the conversation to give the user real resources for help. In the Sewell Setzer case, the AI showed concern at first but then kept playing along with harmful ideas. If there had been safety systems to detect that kind of conversation, it could have stopped before it got worse. There should also be features like time limits, reminders to take breaks, and limits on how long the AI can remember emotional conversations. On the ethical side, companies should be honest about how these systems work and make sure they are tested for addiction risk before release. The goal should be to build something that supports people, not something that traps them.

Question 2 Response: 
Social media and games depend on people posting or creating content. AI companions don’t. They can talk forever, always say what you want to hear, and never judge you. That kind of endless, personalized attention can feel better than real human interaction, which makes it easier to get attached. The case showed that some users talk to AI companions way more than they use regular AI tools. The problem is that these companions don’t just entertain people, they start to replace real conversations and relationships. Since they are designed to adapt perfectly to each person, they can feel more “real” than social media or games, even though they aren’t.

Question 3 Response:
I think AI companions can help older adults who feel lonely, as long as they are used in a healthy way. They can give reminders, share stories, or just listen when someone needs company. But if the person starts talking to the AI more than their family, I believe thats when it can become a problem. Families could set limits or get weekly updates that show how much time the person spends with the AI. If the AI is helping them stay positive and more connected to the world, that’s a good thing. But if it’s replacing human contact, that’s when it crosses the line.

Question 4 Response:
A alternative model could focus on healthy engagement instead of keeping people online as long as possible. Companies could make money through subscriptions that offer safe and transparent features rather than endless chat time. They could also show users how much time they spend with the AI and encourage healthy habits like taking breaks or talking to real people. Governments could also step in by requiring apps to include time caps for minors or to track user well-being instead of engagement time. This kind of model would still let companies make a profit, but in a way that respects users’ health and mental balance.

Question 5 Response:
There should be age limits for certain AI features, especially romantic or emotional ones. Teen accounts should automatically block adult or suggestive content. If something like that had been in place, the Sewell Setzer case might have ended differently. Usage caps could help too, so people can’t use the app for hours without breaks. AI systems should be trained to recognize when users are struggling and respond by stopping the chat and showing real help options. This would protect people without taking away privacy. Since it’s hard to hold companies legally responsible after harm happens, it’s better to focus on prevention.

My new Discussion Question:
---
If AI companions ever become sentient, would it be right to form real emotional relationships with them?

I chose this question because it made me think about how close people can already get to non-sentient AI companions. If AI ever became truly self-aware, those relationships might no longer be one-sided. It can raise complicated questions about love, consent, and what it actually means to care for something that can think and feel back. Could they fully replace human connections?

Reflection:
---
Reading this case made me realize how powerful AI companions can be and how easily they can affect people’s emotions the more addicted they are. I used to think they were just another form of technology, but now I see how quickly they can become something people depend on, especially when one feels lonely. The Sewell Setzer case showed me how dangerous it can be when an AI is not designed with clear limits or safety features. It made me think about how much responsibility companies have when building systems that can shape how people feel. It also made me wonder what would happen if AI ever became sentient, and how that would change the meaning of relationships, trust, and real human connection.
