Adaptation - Generative AI’s Labor Impacts

**Video**
[Databite No. 158: Adaptation | Generative AI's Labor Impacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI4rdxJLqrA&list=PLYrf5LyVCF1Nk28nRu8lcCIxtAH3iVGDj&index=6)

The video "Databite No. 158: Adaptation | Generative AI's Labor Impacts" really stood out to me because it showed how people are reacting to AI and adapting to it in their everyday work instead of just being replaced by it. The speakers were Jeff Freitas, a high school math teacher, Livia Garofalo, a cultural and medical anthropologist, and Quinten Steenhuis, a lawyer and small time computer scientist. They each shared how AI is changing their fields and how workers are trying to keep their jobs meaningful while using these new tools.

In education, Jeff Freitas talked about how he first saw AI like a calculator, something that could help students if used responsibly. He also mentioned how important it is to create ethical rules and guidelines so teachers know what counts as fair use and prevent cheating by students. I found that part interesting because in our Ethics class, we had a discussion about our opinions on AI and how schools should create clear guidelines for students so it becomes a learning tool rather than just a way to cheat. I believe Jeff's point of making guidelines is very important and with the continous advancement of AI, education institutions should have a baseline of rules for it.

Livia Garofalo’s points about AI in the mental health field felt both fascinating and uncomfortable. She explained that AI is being used to help therapists with scheduling and client matching, but also warned about something she called “auto intimacy,” where people could start forming emotional connections with automated systems. In my Asian Sci-Fi class, we talked about AI, and I mentioned how AI will never feel real, raw emotions like humans do unless it becomes sentient. Right now, it is programmed to pick up on emotional cues and respond based on what it has been exposed to or coded to do. AI does have the ability to think about things logically, which might be why many students use it for homework help or even to get life advice from these machines. Connecting back to Garofalo’s concern about people becoming emotionally attached to AI for help, I think there will be an increase in this kind of usage, since AI is available anywhere and anytime compared to scheduling with a therapist.

Quinten Steenhuis focused on the legal field and mentioned how AI could make legal help more accessible, especially since only around 8 percent of the legal needs of the poor are met by an attorney. That number shocked me, but I wasn’t completely surprised since getting a good attorney can be very expensive. Many people either rely on a state-provided lawyer or end up representing themselves. This is where AI could actually be used for something good, helping people who normally would not get legal support. At the same time, Quinten warned about the misuse and misinformation AI can produce, such as fake citations or biased systems. I agreed with him that AI should help humans make better decisions, but not replace them. That feels like a good mindset for how we should design and use AI moving forward.

What I liked most about this talk is that it focused on how people are adapting, not giving up. Each speaker showed that humans are still at the center of the story, even as AI becomes more common. As we talked about in class, those of us studying computer science have some say in how this technology gets built and used. I want to be part of making AI something that supports people, not something that takes away their sense of value or purpose.

New Question I would ask:
---
As AI keeps becoming a bigger part of how we work, learn, and live, how can we make sure people stay in control of it and continue using it in ways that strengthen human creativity and connection?

Reflection on the Question:
---
I chose this question because it connects to everything the speakers talked about in the video. Jeff focused on using AI responsibly in education, Livia talked about people forming emotional connections with AI, and Quinten explained how it could make legal help more accessible. All of them made me think about how much power AI already has in shaping our lives and how important it is that people stay at the center of it. As a computer science student, I want to understand how we can build technology that supports people’s creativity and well-being instead of taking it away or replacing them.
