Looking at how students view AI and what it means for the future of college

**News Article**
[How AI is Changing-Not 'Killing'-College](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2025/08/29/survey-college-students-views-ai)

Why I chose this article
---
I picked this article because it connects AI directly to college life. Many people say AI is “killing” college, but students in the survey do not agree. Most believe AI has not lowered the value of college, and some even think it makes college more valuable. I wanted to write about this because it shows a more balanced view and challenges the extreme claims.

Argument
---
P1: 85 percent of students say they have used AI for coursework.

P2: Most students say AI has not lowered the value of college, and some say it has made it more valuable.

P3: Students want colleges to create rules and guidance for AI instead of banning it.

C: Therefore, AI is changing but not killing college, and schools should adapt to it instead of resisting it.

Rebuttal
---
Some people worry that because AI can influence students critical thinking skills, this automatically means college is “dead.” This is a non-sequitur fallacy, because that conclusion does not follow from the evidence. The survey in the article shows a mix of outcomes. Many students say AI has not changed the value of college at all, and others even say it increased the value. The concerns about critical thinking do not logically prove that college is collapsing.

P4: The idea that AI will “kill” college does not follow from the survey’s mixed results.

P5: The article shows that 35 percent of students say the value of college has not changed, and 23 percent say it has increased.
 
P6: Colleges can guide responsible AI use to prevent overreliance.  

R: Therefore, the claim that AI is destroying college does not logically follow from the evidence, and the article’s point that AI is changing but not ending college is more accurate.

Alternative Argument
---
C2: Even if AI is becoming more normal in college, schools should require students to disclose when they use AI so learning stays honest and instructors can see the difference between student work and AI assistance.

My Recommendation
---
Colleges should not ban AI. Instead, they should create clear rules, teach students how to use it responsibly, and design assignments that encourage real learning with it.

Reflection
---
Writing this blog made me realize that AI can be very useful and should be treated as a tool to help us. At the same time, I can see how it can negatively impact us if people rely on it too much. The survey showed me that most students do not see AI as destroying college, but they do recognize both the benefits and the risks. This exercise taught me how important it is to look past exaggerated claims and focus on real experiences, while also thinking about how to use AI responsibly.
