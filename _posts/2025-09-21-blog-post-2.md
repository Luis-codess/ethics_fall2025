Looking at how students view AI and what it means for the future of college

**News Article**
[How AI is Changing-Not 'Killing'-College](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2025/08/29/survey-college-students-views-ai)

Why I chose this article
---
I picked this article because it connects AI directly to college life. Many people say AI is “killing” college, but students in the survey do not agree. Most believe AI has not lowered the value of college, and some even think it makes college more valuable. I wanted to write about this because it shows a more balanced view and challenges the extreme claims.

Argument
---
P1: 85 percent of students say they have used AI for coursework.

P2: Most students say AI has not lowered the value of college, and some say it has made it more valuable.

P3: Students want colleges to create rules and guidance for AI instead of banning it.

C: Therefore, AI is changing but not killing college, and schools should adapt to it instead of resisting it.

Rebuttal
---
The claim that AI will “kill” college contains a straw man fallacy. It exaggerates the effects of AI by saying it will completely destroy higher education. The survey shows AI can help in some cases and cause problems in others, but it is not wiping out the value of college.

P4: Saying AI will kill college is an exaggeration that misrepresents what is happening.

P5: Students report both good and bad effects from AI, not total destruction.

P6: Schools can adapt by teaching students how to use AI responsibly.

R: Therefore, the idea that AI will kill college is wrong, and the article’s point that AI is reshaping, not killing, higher education is more accurate.

Alternative Argument
---
C2: Even though AI has not destroyed college, it could weaken students’ critical thinking if they rely on it too much.

My Recommendation
---
Colleges should not ban AI. Instead, they should create clear rules, teach students how to use it responsibly, and design assignments that encourage real learning with it.

Reflection
---
Writing this blog made me realize that AI can be very useful and should be treated as a tool to help us. At the same time, I can see how it can negatively impact us if people rely on it too much. The survey showed me that most students do not see AI as destroying college, but they do recognize both the benefits and the risks. This exercise taught me how important it is to look past exaggerated claims and focus on real experiences, while also thinking about how to use AI responsibly.
