Exploring how AI regulation can balance innovation, safety, and human dignity

**News Article**  
[How to regulate AI article](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/how-to-regulate-artificial-intelligence-ai/)

Why I chose this article
---
I picked “How to Regulate Artificial Intelligence” from the Harvard Gazette because AI is growing every day and it feels like there is not a clear ceiling to how far it can go. Society is beginning to rely on AI in more areas of life such as healthcare, finance, and personal support, and that raises urgent questions about safety, fairness, and responsibility. I wanted to explore this article because it shows how crucial regulation will be as AI becomes more deeply embedded in the way we live.

Main points of ethical concern
---
Scams and manipulation: AI can be used to trick and take advantage of people.

Financial risks: AI agents in cryptocurrency could cause damage that cannot be reversed.

Mental health advice: Chatbots can cross dangerous lines without the right rules in place.

Global competition: Countries may focus too much on competing instead of working together.

Balancing innovation and safety: It is hard to grow AI technology while also protecting people’s rights.

These concerns show that AI is not only about technology but also about moral choices that affect society.

Stakeholders
---
Tech Companies: Create and sell AI, often focused on profit and speed.

Governments and Regulators: Make laws and rules, but usually fall behind the fast pace of AI.

Everyday People: Benefit from AI but can also be harmed by scams, bias, or unsafe systems.

Healthcare Providers and Patients: Use AI for care and support but face risks if it is not safe.

Global Community: The way AI is managed affects fairness and cooperation worldwide.

Vulnerable Groups: People like the elderly, teens, or marginalized communities often face the biggest risks but have the least say in regulation.

Ethical Frameworks
---
Utilitarianism (Greatest Good for the Greatest Number)

Right action: Create rules for AI that bring the most benefits, like better healthcare and safety, while reducing harms like scams or unsafe advice.

Wrong action: Letting AI grow without rules, which helps a few companies but causes harm for many people.

Duty Ethics (Doing What Is Right Regardless of Outcomes)

Right action: Governments and companies should respect people’s rights, like privacy and safety. For example, making sure mental health AI is held to high standards of care.

Wrong action: Ignoring these duties and allowing AI systems to take advantage of vulnerable people.

Reflection
---
Writing this blog made me realize how complicated AI regulation really is. At first, I thought it was only about rules and policies, but I learned that ethical frameworks change how we see what is right and wrong. Utilitarianism makes us think about the overall good and harm, while duty ethics reminds us that some rights should always be respected no matter what.
