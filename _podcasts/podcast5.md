details about this podcast:
In this episode we talk about how memes create meaning and how we actually read them in digital spaces. We break down what makes a meme clear or confusing, how cultural context shapes interpretation, and why memes spread so quickly. We also reflect on the ethical side of memes, including what happens when people misinterpret them and how virality can shape political or social conversations.
