Microtransactions have grown into one of the biggest changes in gaming, shaping how players experience games and how companies make money. They began with early online games that let players buy simple cosmetic items, then spread quickly as mobile games and app stores became popular. The freemium model played a huge role by letting players download games for free but pay for boosts, power-ups, or items that made the experience easier or more exciting. As this model proved extremely profitable, companies started using microtransactions in larger console and PC games, including loot boxes and gacha systems that used random rewards to keep players spending. This caused a lot of debate, especially when fully priced games used these systems in ways that affected fairness or pushed players toward spending more than they planned. Over time, developers began experimenting with different monetization styles, like battle passes, cosmetic shops, and subscription models, while still keeping microtransactions at the center of their business. Microtransactions also changed how games are designed because developers now think about long term engagement and spending habits from the very beginning of the design process. This history shows how microtransactions became normal in almost every genre of gaming, and why they raise questions about player behavior, fairness, and the impact these systems can have on future habits.
