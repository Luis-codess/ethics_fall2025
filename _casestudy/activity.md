Scenario:
You are part of a game development team creating a popular gacha game that is played by millions of people, including children and teens. The game relies heavily on microtransactions to stay profitable.

Task:
Choose one of the following options and explain your reasoning in 2–5 sentences, considering both players and developers.

Option A: Keep the gacha system as it is, but clearly show drop rates and warnings.

Option B: Add spending limits and stricter controls for minors, even if it lowers profit.

Option C: Remove chance-based purchases entirely and replace them with direct item purchases.

## options
If you choose Option A

Keeping the gacha system while adding drop rate transparency and warnings means the game remains mostly the same. The company continues earning strong profits, and players technically have more information before spending. However, younger and more vulnerable players may still overspend, since knowing the odds does not always stop impulsive behavior. This option improves transparency but offers limited protection from harm.

If you choose Option B

Adding spending limits and stricter controls for minors reduces the risk of overspending among children and teens. This choice prioritizes player safety and responsibility, even though it may lower company profits. The game becomes safer for younger players, but some users may feel restricted, and developers may face financial pressure from reduced revenue.

If you choose Option C

Removing chance-based purchases and switching to direct item purchases eliminates gambling-like mechanics entirely. Players always know what they are paying for, which greatly reduces financial and emotional risk. However, this option significantly changes the game’s monetization model and may reduce revenue or alter how content updates are funded.
