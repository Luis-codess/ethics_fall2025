## Players
Players, especially children and teens, are the group most directly affected by microtransactions because they spend the most time in these gaming environments and are still developing their decision making skills. Many young players do not fully understand how odds, spending, or reward systems work, so the excitement of opening loot boxes or pulling for rare items can feel harmless even when it leads to overspending. Games often use bright visuals, quick animations, and the thrill of surprise to make these moments feel rewarding, which can make kids want to try again even when the chances of winning something good are low. For teens, microtransactions can become tied to social pressure, since rare items or limited cosmetics can make them feel included or left out among friends. Younger players are also more likely to chase a reward because they feel close to getting it, and they may waste money trying to fix a bad pull or keep up with others. Over time, these habits can teach players to rely on risky spending patterns without realizing it, which is why this group is the most vulnerable to the long term effects of microtransaction systems.
