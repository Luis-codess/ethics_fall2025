## introduction

Microtransactions are everywhere in modern video games. Players buy items, characters, or bonuses with real money, and many games use systems like loot boxes and gacha pulls to give out random rewards. Even though these features are made to keep games fun, research shows they can influence players in ways that look a lot like gambling. Many games use chance, surprise, and unpredictable outcomes to keep people spending, especially when the reward feels close or the player almost gets something rare. Studies also show that younger players are the most exposed to these systems. Gaming is a normal part of everyday life for kids and teens, so they interact with these mechanics without thinking about how they work. Research from large groups of young players shows that many of them spend money on in-game purchases and often try to get rare items through repeated pulls. These habits matter because there is a clear link between higher spending on loot boxes and stronger signs of problem gaming and gambling behaviors later on. Gacha systems make this even more complicated. They use specific drop rates and sometimes a pity mechanic that improves the chance of getting a rare item only after many failed attempts. This encourages players to keep trying because they feel like they are getting closer each time. Some people end up spending more than they planned because they feel too invested to stop or because the system makes it feel like the next try might be the lucky one. The gaming industry benefits a lot from these designs. Microtransactions bring in huge amounts of money, so companies have reasons to keep these systems in place. Some companies even use player data to push offers that match each person’s behavior. The problem is that this creates a conflict between profit and player well-being. The research shows that these systems can lead to overspending, frustration, or long-term gambling-like habits, especially for younger players. This case study looks at how microtransactions and gacha systems affect players, what the research says about future gambling behaviors, and why this matters. It explores how these mechanics work, why they are effective, and what responsibilities developers, regulators, and players have in creating safe and fair gaming environments.
