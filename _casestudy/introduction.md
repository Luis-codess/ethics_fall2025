## introduction

Microtransactions are everywhere in modern video games. Players buy items, characters, or bonuses with real money, and many games use systems like loot boxes and gacha pulls to give out random rewards. Even though these features are meant to keep games fun, research shows they can influence players in ways that look a lot like gambling. Many games use chance, surprise, and unpredictable outcomes to keep people spending, especially when a reward feels close or when the chance of getting something rare slowly increases. Younger players are especially exposed to these systems. Gaming is a normal part of everyday life for kids and teens, so they often interact with these mechanics without fully thinking about how they work. Research on young players shows that many of them spend money on in-game purchases and repeatedly try to obtain extremely rare items. These habits matter because higher spending on loot boxes has been linked to stronger signs of unhealthy gaming and gambling behaviors later on. Gacha systems make this even more complicated. They use specific drop rates and sometimes a pity mechanic that improves the chance of getting a rare item only after many failed attempts. This encourages players to keep spending because they feel like they are getting closer each time. Some players end up spending more than they intended without receiving the item they want, which makes them feel too invested to stop. Instead of walking away with nothing, they continue spending to reach the pity system or hoping the next attempt will finally be the lucky one, making the money already spent feel less wasted. The gaming industry benefits greatly from these designs. Microtransactions bring in huge amounts of money, giving companies strong reasons to keep these systems in place. Some companies also use player data to push offers that match individual behavior. The problem is that this creates a conflict between profit and player well-being. Research shows that these systems can lead to overspending, frustration, and long-term gambling-like habits, especially for younger players. This case study looks at how microtransactions and gacha systems affect players, what research says about future gambling behaviors, and why this matters. It explores how these mechanics work, why they are effective, and what responsibilities developers, regulators, and players have in creating safe and fair gaming environments.
